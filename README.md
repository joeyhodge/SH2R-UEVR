# SH2R-UEVR

UEVR improvements/motion controls for SILENT HILL 2 (2024)

## Features
* First Person
* Motion controls (no melee swinging yet)
* Two handing of rifle and shotgun
* Roomscale movement
* Properly projected crosshair in 3D space
* Automatic disabling of VR features in cutscenes and full body events (though still fully 6DOF and stereoscopic)

Inverse kinematics has been loosely explored, but not working correctly. So body has been hidden for now, and re-enabled in cutscenes and events.

## Install

Get the latest release zip and click "Import Config" in UEVR, browse to the zip and click it.
